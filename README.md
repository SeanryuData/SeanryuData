### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Sean's Data Analytic Portfolio.
<h1>Project Title</h1>

<p>This is a project I decided to create for the purpose of gaining experience and utilizing my data analytics skills, which I acquired through various certification programs in SQL and PowerBI.</p>

<h2>Certifications Earned</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>I used the following data set as the basis for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data set name:</strong> <em>CafÃ©, restaurant, bistro seats
</em></li>
  <li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/cafes-and-restaurants-with-seating-capacity/information/
">Data set URL</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Reason for Choosing Data</h2>
<p>I chose this data set because of my recent coffee trip to Melbourne. As a coffee fan, I heard a lot about the coffee culture in Melbourne, and I thought it would be both enjoyable and educative for me to find insights to share from the data set. Additionally, I wanted to compare my findings from data analytics to my personal experience when I visited Melbourne in March 2023.</p>

<h2>Coding Information</h2>
<p>All of my code is contained in a single SQL file. I have included comments for each step to explain the reasoning behind my choices. Most, if not all, of the table alterations were made in SQL for the purposes of demonstrating my proficiency in the language.</p>

<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>This project is being worked on daily in my free time after work, so please check for updates regularly. As of now, the project is ongoing.</p>
