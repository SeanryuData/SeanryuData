### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Sean's Data Analytic Portfolio.
<h1>Project Melbourne Cafe</h1>

<p>This is a project I decided to create for the purpose of gaining experience and utilizing my data analytics skills, which I acquired through various certification programs in SQL and PowerBI.</p>

<h2>Data Source</h2>
<p>I used the following data set as the basis for this project:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data set name:</strong> <em>CafÃ©, restaurant, bistro seats
</em></li>
  <li><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/cafes-and-restaurants-with-seating-capacity/information/
">Data set URL</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Purpose of the Project</h2>
<p>This is a project I created to apply and gain experience in my data analytics skills, which I learned through certifications in SQL and Power BI.
I chose the cafes and restaurants with seating capacity data set from the Melbourne government website (https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/explore/dataset/cafes-and-restaurants-with-seating-capacity/information/) as it aligns with my recent coffee trip to Melbourne. As a coffee enthusiast, I was intrigued by the coffee culture in Melbourne and wanted to find insights to share from the data set. Moreover, I wanted to compare my data analytics findings to my personal experience visiting Melbourne in March 202</p>

<h2>Coding Information</h2>
<p>All of my code is contained in a single SQL file, which I have extensively commented on to explain the reasoning behind my choices. For the purpose of demonstrating my proficiency in the language, most, if not all, of the table alterations were made in SQL.</p>


<h2>Project Status</h2>
<p>This project is being worked on daily in my free time after work, so please check for updates regularly. As of now, the project is ongoing.
</p>

<h2>Programmes used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>
SSMS (MySQL - took more than 1 hour to import data, so changed to SSMS)</em></li>
<li><em>Microsoft Power BI</em></li>
<li><em>Microsoft Onedrive Excel</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Exploration#1</h3>
<p>
The original data set was downloaded in CSV, uploaded to Onedrive folder for an initial exploration.
Then to increase the performance inside SSMS
eliminated unncessary columns, then to practice joining inside SQL, I purposly split the file into two parts [Shop] and [Add].
</p>

<h3>Data exploration#2</h3>
<p>
After completing the Data ETL - Extract, Transform (refer to project.sql), then loading to Power BI. I found two "Flaws" inside the data set (Refer to below SC:)

After further modifying the "View" tables inside  SQL, I
