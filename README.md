### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Sean's Data Analytic Portfolio.

Melbourne Cafe Data Analysis Project
This is a personal project that I created to gain experience and utilize my data analytics skills, which I acquired through my certifications in SQL and PowerBI. I have earned the following certifications:

Certification A
Certification B
Certification C
The goal of this project is to analyze data on cafes and restaurants in Melbourne, which I obtained from the Melbourne Open Data website. As a coffee fan, I have always been intrigued by the coffee culture in Melbourne and wanted to explore the data to gain insights about the industry.

This project is being worked on daily during my free time after work, and I will continue to update it with new findings and insights.

Data
The dataset I used in this project contains information about cafes and restaurants in Melbourne, including their seating capacity, location, and other relevant details. I chose this dataset because of my recent trip to Melbourne and my interest in coffee culture.

Methodology
For this project, I used SQL to clean and transform the data, and PowerBI to visualize the results. I have included a single SQL file in this repository that contains all of my code. I have also added comments to each step to explain my thought process and reasoning behind the changes I made.

Results
Through my analysis, I have gained several insights about the Melbourne cafe and restaurant industry. For example, I found that the majority of cafes and restaurants have a seating capacity of 50 or less, and that the most common seating type is indoor seating. I have also created several visualizations in PowerBI to better understand the data.

Conclusion
Overall, this project has been a valuable learning experience for me, as it allowed me to apply my data analytics skills to a real-world dataset. I am excited to continue working on this project and exploring the data further.

Future Work
In the future, I plan to expand my analysis to include more variables, such as the type of cuisine offered and the prices of the cafes and restaurants. I also plan to incorporate machine learning techniques to predict customer satisfaction and other metrics.
